## Basic Details
### Team Name: Street

### Project Description
It is a task reminder website in which you are able to assign tasks with deadlines. The quirk about the website is that the reminder for a task is sometimes shown after the deadline or before like 10 mins before the actual deadline, along with demotivating messages

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Having too much work to do that a person is not able to keep up with their work load

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Creating a "good" task reminder app which reminds you of tasks you have to do
